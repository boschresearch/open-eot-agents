# Service Directory Smart Contracts

To develop the smart contracts, the [Truffle suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview) is used.

It is preconfigured to use a local running [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/overview) on port 8545 on localhost.

## Prerequisities

1. Installation of [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart)
2. Installation of [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation)

## Using it with truffle

Common commands from [Quickstart](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/quickstart):

* Compiling solidity contracts using `truffle compile`.
* Migrating/deploying to Ganache using `truffle migrate`.
* Running provided tests with `truffle test`.

ABI for further usage can be found under build/contracts folder.
